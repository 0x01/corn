Description: 
 The Constructive Coq Repository at Nijmegen, C-CoRN, aims at building
 a computer based library of constructive mathematics, formalized in
 the theorem prover Coq.
 It includes in particular a constructive proof of the Fundamental
 Theorem of Algebra (every non-trivial polynomial equation P(z)=0
 always has a solution in the complex plane)
Keywords: FTA, Fundamental, Theorem, Algebra, Constructive, Real, Complex,
