Description: 
 The Constructive Coq Repository at Nijmegen, C-CoRN, aims at building
 a computer based library of constructive mathematics, formalized in
 the theorem prover Coq. It includes the following parts:

*  Algebraic Hierarchy

   o An axiomatic formalization of the most common algebraic
     structures, including setoids, monoids, groups, rings,
     fields, ordered fields, rings of polynomials, real and
     complex numbers

* Model of the Real Numbers

   o Construction of a concrete real number structure
     satisfying the previously defined axioms

* Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

   o A proof that every non-constant polynomial on the complex
     plane has at least one root

* Real Calculus

   o A collection of elementary results on real analysis,
     including continuity, differentiability, integration,
     Taylor's theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
