C-CoRN, the Coq Constructive Repository at Nijmegen
---------------------------------------------------

PREREQUISITES
-------------

 This version of C-CoRN is known to compile with:

 - Coq version revision 13689 from the trunk branch

 - Ssreflect revision 1292 from the trunk branch in the coq-contrib repository.
   This exact revision can be obtained by saying:
    svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/coq-contribs/trunk/Saclay/Ssreflect -r 1292
   Currently only the ssreflect binary compiles, the standard library is broken.
   However, CoRN does not depend on the library.
   Build a customized Coqide interface linked with ssreflect. After having compiled ssreflect toplevel, go to the src/ subdirectory and execute the command
   coqmktop -opt ssreflect.cmx -o ../bin/coqtop.opt
   coqmktop -ide -opt ssreflect.cmx -o ../bin/ssrcoqide

 - SCons 1.2

BUILDING C-CoRN
---------------

C-CoRN uses SCons for its build infrastructure. SCons is a modern
Python-based Make-replacement.

To build C-CoRN with SCons:

1. Point environment variable SSRDIR to the directory where ssreflect
   can be found (i.e. the one with subdirectories 'bin' and 'theories').

2. Say "scons" to build the whole library, or "scons some/module.vo"
   to just build some/module.vo (and its dependencies).

In addition to common Make options like -j N and -k, SCons
supports some useful options of its own, such as --debug=time, which
displays the time spent executing individual build commands.

scons -c replaces Make clean

For more information, see the SCons documentation at

  http://www.scons.org/


BUILDING DOCUMENTATION
----------------------

To build CoqDoc documentation, say "scons coqdoc".

A dependency graph in DOT format can be created with "scons deps.dot".
